# react-redux-starter-kit

Here i have create simple boiler plate for React js project. I have set up redux-thunk.

In this boiler plate i have added flow like login, autocomplete using debounce and user profile.

Also include some library.

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/overview">Formik</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify#readme">React Toastify</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton#readme">React Loading Skeleton</a></li>
</ul>

Hope this will be useful.
